      "question": "Why is it recommended to select a lower gear before driving up or down a steep hill?",
      "answer": "Selecting a lower gear before driving up or down a steep hill is recommended because it provides better control and power. When going uphill, a lower gear prevents the vehicle from stalling and makes it easier to climb without having to change gears on the slope, which could cause the vehicle to roll backwards. When going downhill, a lower gear allows the engine to help slow the vehicle (engine braking), reducing reliance on the foot-brake and preventing the brakes from overheating and losing effectiveness."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of turning the front wheels outward when parking facing uphill and inward when parking facing downhill on a slope?",
      "answer": "Turning the front wheels outward when parking facing uphill ensures that if the vehicle rolls backward, the wheels will hit the kerb and stop the vehicle from moving further. Conversely, turning the wheels inward when parking facing downhill ensures that if the vehicle rolls forward, the wheels will again hit the kerb and prevent the vehicle from rolling into traffic or down the slope. This practice helps prevent accidents caused by vehicles sliding on slopes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it important not to tailgate the vehicle in front when driving in traffic?",
